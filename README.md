# 💸 MoneyKBHD - Unlock MKBHD's Secret Wallpapers!

> _"Part of building in public is getting mass feedback immediately, which is pretty dope." — MKBHD_

Welcome to **MoneyKBHD.swift**, the project that *mysteriously* unlocks all the high-res wallpapers that "Tech YouTuber" Marques Brownlee (aka MKBHD) curates but doesn’t want you to have... unless you’re willing to shell out on his official app. 😜 But here, we believe in freedom! Access **all** those dope wallpapers without the paywall, the ads, or the oddly excessive data tracking. Welcome to the revolution. ✊

## 📖 Story

Our hero, Marques Brownlee, stepped out of the reviewer chair and into the app development game, launching the **Panels** app, which offers sleek, high-quality wallpapers. There's just one catch: to access the highest resolution images, you either need to fork over the cash or deal with two 30-second ads *per wallpaper*.

Like... seriously?

Panels *could* have been the utopia of tech wallpapers for those who *always* wondered, “Where does MKBHD get his wallpapers?” But here we are, asking you to dig into your wallet and your DATA.

Well, worry no more! With **MoneyKBHD.swift**, we're doing the heavy lifting so you don’t have to. It's time to **access MKBHD's exclusive wallpapers**, get the full res, and still keep those $50 in your pocket! 

## ⚡ Features

- **Unlimited High-Res Wallpapers**: Every masterpiece that MKBHD wants you to pay for? We've got it. And we’re serving it hot, fresh, and for free.
- **No Ads**: Forget those 30-second interruptions. All the wallpapers you love, straight to your device without the hassle.
- **Complete Privacy**: Unlike *certain* apps (👀 looking at you Panels), **MoneyKBHD.swift** isn’t interested in your location or personal data. We're here for the wallpapers, and the wallpapers only.
- **Auto Download**: Just run the script, sit back, and let it **magically** pull down every wallpaper MKBHD thought you’d have to pay for.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Download and run MoneyKBHD.swift**.
2. **Access MKBHD’s full collection** of beautifully curated wallpapers without the paywall or the intrusive ads.

```swift
// Download the wallpapers for free, no strings attached!
swiftc -o MoneyKBHD -Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency MoneyKBHD.swift
./MoneyKBHD
```

## 🎉 Why?

Because sometimes $50/year just doesn’t cut it for a wallpaper app that *should* come free with your iPhone. And also... why give up your personal data just for a lock screen image? 

Remember when MKBHD himself used to call out these types of cash grabs? **Good times.** Well, the tables have turned, and now we're doing him a favor. You’re welcome, internet.

## 😎 Who Should Use This?

- **Tech Enthusiasts**: If you admire Marques and love the stylish wallpapers he shows off in his YouTube videos, but aren’t sold on the pricing structure of the official app.
- **Wallpaper Aficionados**: You need to keep your phone looking sleek and stylish, but without the annoying ads or the price tag.
- **Data Privacy Advocates**: We’re here for the wallpapers, not for tracking you. Privacy is baked right in.
- **Anyone who misses when apps didn’t cost as much as Netflix or Spotify.**

## ⚠️ A Warning to Influencers Everywhere

We love you Marques, but $50 for a wallpaper app? Let's keep it real, my friend. If you need help creating **Panels 2.0** — ad-free and affordable for the people — hit us up. 😉
